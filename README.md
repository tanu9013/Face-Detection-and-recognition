# Face-Detection-and-recognition
This project focuses on implementing a robust face detection and recognition system using Python and deep learning. It leverages computer vision techniques to detect human faces in images or real-time video feeds and then recognizes known individuals by comparing their facial features with pre-registered profiles. The system uses models like Haar Cascades, MTCNN, or Dlib for face detection and embeddings from FaceNet or DeepFace for recognition. Ideal for security applications, attendance systems, or smart surveillance, the project allows training with custom face datasets and supports both live webcam input and video files.
